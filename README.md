#TOPICA: A Topic based forum
##Topica is a CRUD application built using Node.js, MongoDB, and Express, among others.

###Overview
Topica was designed to allow users to create a topic of their choice, that they, and other users can then post articles to. Articles within a topic can then be upvoted or downvoted, changing their position in the stack. Users can see all articles created by another user, and edit or delete their own articles at will. Topics, on the other hand, cannot be removed, as the goal is to have a wide range of topics available for people to write about.

Topica is currently being hosted on Heroku, and was built using Node.js, MongoDB, Express, EJS, HTML, and CSS. 

###Planning


###Future Plans
Future upgrades include full encryption, the ability to add images to posts, more robust user profiles, properly formatted articles, among other things.
